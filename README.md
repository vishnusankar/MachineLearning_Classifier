# MachineLearning_Classifier
I tried these binary classification algorithms to find out which one is best. 

## Algorithms & Confusion Matrix's Correct Prediction
  - Logistic Regression - (930)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) - (922)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
    - RBF - (929)
    - **Linear - (932)**
    - Poly - (923)
    - Sigmoid - (898)
  - Naive Bayes - (856)
  - Decision Tree Classification
    - Criterion (entropy) - (877)
    - Criterion (gini) - (894)
  - Random Forest Classification - (931)
  - **Deep Learning (ANN) - (932)**
