# MachineLearning_Classifier
I tried these binary classification algorithms to find out which one is best. 

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - RBF
  - Linear
  - Poly
  - Sigmoid
4. Precompiled
5. Naive Bayes.
6. Decision Tree Classification
  - Criterion - entropy
  - Criterion - gini
7. Random Forest Classification
8. Deep Learning (ANN)

I am using UCI Machine Learning Repository details are given bellow:
