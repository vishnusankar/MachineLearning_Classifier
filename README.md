# MachineLearning_Classifier
I tried these binary classification algorithms to find out which one is best. 

  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
    - RBF
    - Linear
    - Poly
    - Sigmoid
  - Precompiled
  - Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree Classification
    - Criterion (entropy)
    - Criterion (gini)
  - Random Forest Classification
  - Deep Learning (ANN)

I am using UCI Machine Learning Repository details are given bellow:
