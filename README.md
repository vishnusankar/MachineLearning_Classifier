# MachineLearning_Classifier
I tried these binary classification algorithms to find out which one is best. 

## Algorithms & Confusion Matrix's Correct Prediction

| Alogrithms | Small Dataset (4119) \nPrediction (%)  | Large Dataset (41188) \nPrediction (%)  |
| :---:         |     :---:           |          :---: |
| Logistic Regression |                |           |
|K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) | 

|Support Vector Machine (SVM) | 
|RBF (SVM)                    | 
|Linear (SVM)                 | 
|Poly (SVM)                   | 
|Sigmoid (SVM)                | 
|Naive Bayes                  | 
|Decision Tree Classification (entropy) | 
|Decision Tree Classification (gini) | 
|Random Forest Classification | 
|Random Forest Classification | 
| **Deep Learning (ANN)**     |
